In this folder, the seg.v file containing the digital from 0-F in LED which is four digits decoder, but in this lab we just need 3 bits and LED digit from 0-9, be aware of this.
Also, change the top module which I do some progress in the next few labs, but did not update for this lab. So, be flexible on this while using.
