# NVBOARD-YSYX
# NJU-DLCO-lecture

My solutions for [DLCO(Digital Logic and Computer Organization) lecture](https://nju-projectn.github.io/dlco-lecture-note/) labs of NJU-ProjectN.

**Due to the plan in YSYX, with respect to the course requirement**

DLCO is the bridging course for Project YSYX.

Each lab eventually runs on NVBoard(another sub-project of NJU-ProjectN), a virtual FPGA.

## Environment

- Linux
- NVBoard
- Verilator
- sdl...

## How to Run

In each subfolder
- `make run` to generate an executable file on NVBoard and run the NVBOARD
- `make clean` to clean the file that generated
